# Immersion React and Next.Js with deploy on Vercel by Alura

# About the immersion

The goal of this immersion is to develop an application of a Quiz - any chosen theme - using React, Next.js and Styled Components as some of the main stacks

## About my project

My quiz is based in a computer game named Tibia. It is a MMORPG that I used to play a long time ago. Check it out [here](https://tibians-quiz.vercel.app/)

## First class

I started the project creating a home page using **React** and put it on-line with Vercel's help! I used **styled-components** to create components, some resources of **Next.js** to generate the initial code of the project and generate the build files.

<details><summary><b>Detailed content of the first class</b></summary>

- Start a project with a boilerplate of React with Next.js and styled.components

- Create some components React using styled-componentes

- Implement a theme to the interface

- Provide the questionnaire theme and data information through a mocked database

- Use Next.js to create a tag `<head>` and the needed meta-infos 

- Publish it on the Vercel

 </details>

## Second class

I learned how to work with states of **React** through **React hooks**, learned what is a **SPA** (Single Page Application), created routes inside our application, used **ESLint** and evolved  components. 

<details><summary><b>Detailed content of the second class</b></summary>

- Install and run ESLint, a linting lib to JavaScript.

- Understand what is an SPA

- Create complex components with styled-components

- Use props with components

- Capture some events in forms (as click)

- Manager states of components with hooks

- Give some data in URLs by `query params`

- Use `next/router` to implement routes

</details>

## Third class

I improve understanding in one of principal themes of React: states management and components lifecycle. Change status and identify the cycle moment, with this was possible update every component, change the components on screen and add efects. I connect tools of React (hooks, components and JSX) to the modern JavaScript logic to load the questions and alternatives of my quiz.

<details><summary><b>Detailed content of the third class</b></summary>

- Create more components

- Work with components properties (props)

- Ensure the properties type with prop-types lib

- Create the quiz page and their components

- Show questions and alternatives on screen from db.json file

- Create forms to manage alternatives

- Work with quiz components states to switch loadings, questions and the result.

- Understand the React components lifecycle

- Use useEffects() to add actions to the components of quiz page
