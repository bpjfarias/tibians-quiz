# Immersion React and Next.Js with deploy on Vercel by Alura

# About the immersion

The goal of this immersion is to develop an application of a Quiz - any chosen theme - using React, Next.js and Styled Components as some of the main stacks

## About my project

My quiz is based in a computer game named Tibia. It is a MMORPG that I used to play a long time ago. Check it out [here](https://tibians-quiz.vercel.app/)

## First class

I started the project creating a home page using **React** and put it on-line with Vercel's help! I used **styled-components** to create components, some resources of **Next.js** to generate the initial code of the project and generate the build files.

<details><summary><b>Detailed content of the first class</b></summary>

- Start a project with a boilerplate of React with Next.js and styled.components

- Create some components React using styled-componentes

- Implement a theme to the interface

- Provide the questionnaire theme and data information through a mocked database

- Use Next.js to create a tag `<head>` and the needed meta-infos 

- Publish it on the Vercel

 </details>

## Second class

I learned how to work with states of **React** through **React hooks**, learned what is a **SPA** (Single Page Application), created routes inside our application, used **ESLint** and evolved  components. 

<details><summary><b>Detailed content of the second class</b></summary>

- Install and run ESLint, a linting lib to JavaScript.

- Understand what is an SPA

- Create complex components with styled-components

- Use props with components

- Capture some events in forms (as click)

- Manager states of components with hooks

- Give some data in URLs by `query params`

- Use `next/router` to implement routes

</details>

## Third class

I improved understanding in one of principal themes of React: **states management and components lifecycle**. Change status and identify the cycle moment, with this was possible update every component, change the components on screen and add efects. I connect tools of React (hooks, components and JSX) to the modern JavaScript logic to load the questions and alternatives of my quiz.

<details><summary><b>Detailed content of the third class</b></summary>

- Create more components

- Work with components properties (props)

- Ensure the properties type with prop-types lib

- Create the quiz page and their components

- Show questions and alternatives on screen from db.json file

- Create forms to manage alternatives

- Work with quiz components states to switch loadings, questions and the result.

- Understand the React components lifecycle

- Use useEffects() to add actions to the components of quiz page

  </details>

## Fourth class

I finished the quiz page with all needed steps to play that: select the alternative, receive on-screen the feedback of right or wrong answer, a point counter and a result page. Over developing understand more about **props behavior**, like work with more than one instance of the same component on screen, develop the logical to capture clicks, treat the results and change components status each user interaction. How to propagante other quizzes on screen, start with Next.js tools to **create endpoints and handle with requests and responses**.

<details><summary><b>Detailed content of the fourth class</b></summary>

- Develop the selection code to choose alternatives for each question

- Statements vs expression

- Learn more about props, like key

- Handle with states and rendering the same component many times

- Logic to select alternatives, enabling button to the next question (using states, HTML attributes and array index)

- Counting logic of points with changing state

- Update points with cycle of React updating

- Show the results page with the sum of the points

- Use the data atributte (data-*) from HTML to give alternatives style information to the components

- Create lambda servers with Next.js to up a endpoint

- Setting CORS configuration to allow requests do other quizzes
